    "\n",
    "Historical efforts in computational drug discovery have focussed on designing small molecule or protein-based medicines that either treat symptoms or counter the end stages of disease processes. In recent years, there is a growing interest in designing new RNA-based therapeutics that intervene earlier in disease processes to cut off disease-causing information flow in the cell [1]. Notable examples of RNA molecules at the forefront of biotechnology today include mRNA vaccines [2], CRISPR-based genomic medicine [3], and riboswitch biosensors [4].\n",

    "<summary><b>Challenges of RNA modelling</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the promises of RNA, proteins have instead been the primary focus in the artificial intelligence and 3D biomolecular modelling community. \n",
    "Availability of large-scale protein structural data from the PDB combined with advances in geometric deep learning for structured data [5] have revolutionized protein 3D structure prediction [6] and design [7, 8].\n",
    "Applications of deep learning for computational RNA design are underexplored compared to proteins due to paucity of 3D structural data [9, 10].\n",
    "Most tools for RNA design primarily focus on secondary structure without considering 3D geometry [11] or use non-learnt algorithms for aligning 3D RNA motifs [12].\n",
    "In addition to limited 3D data for training deep learning models, the key technical challenge is that RNA is more dynamic than proteins.\n",
    "The same RNA can adopt multiple distinct conformational states to create and regulate complex biological functions [13, 14, 15].\n",
    "Computational RNA design pipelines must account for both the 3D geometric structure and conformational flexibility of RNA to engineer new biological functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is gRNAde?**\n",
    "\n",
    "gRNAde aims to be a modern, deep learning-based toolkit for RNA sequence design conditioned on 3D structure, analogous to [ProteinMPNN](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN) for protein design.\n",
    "gRNAde generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more backbone 3D conformations, enabling both single- and multi-state fixed-backbone sequence design.\n",
    "The model is trained on all RNA structures from the PDB at 4.0A or better resolution (12K 3D structures from 4.2K unique RNAs) [16], ranging from short RNAs such as riboswitches, aptamers and ribozymes to larger ribosomal RNAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to use gRNAde for two RNA inverse design tasks:\n",
    "1. Fixed backbone redesign of an RNA backbone, ie. single-state design.\n",
    "2. Fixed backbone redesign of an ensemble of RNA backbones, ie. multi-state design.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also compare gRNAde to Rosetta [17], an existing physics-based tools for 3D RNA inverse design, for single-state fixed backbone design of 14 RNA structures of interest from the PDB identified by Das et al. [18].\n",
    "We obtain higher native sequence recovery rates with gRNAde (54% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), while expecting gRNAde to be significantly faster (order of seconds compared to order of hours for Rosetta).\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "gRNAde is available as a free and open-source software at `https://github.com/chaitjo/geometric-rna-design`, along with detailed setup and usage instructions.\n",
    "We have tested gRNAde on Linux with Python 3.10.12 and CUDA 11.8 on an NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU, as well as on MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone or download files from the GitHub repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/chaitjo/geometric-rna-design.git; cd geometric-rna-design\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Follow the installation instructions in the README file to set up your python environment and install all dependencies (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric) and external tools (EternaFold, X3DNA).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up your `.env` file with the appropriate environment variables; see `.env.example` for reference. Alternatively, export environment variables pointing to EternaFold and X3DNA directories; for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PROJECT_PATH='/home/ckj24/geometric-rna-design/'\n",

    "\n",
    "### Input Data Format and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The input format for gRNAde is via PDB files of RNA structures. Internally, gRNAde builds a 3-bead coarse-grained representation of the RNA backbone, retaining the coordinates for P, C4', N1 (pyrimidine) or N9 (purine) for each nucleotide [19]. This 3-bead pseudotorsional representation can describe RNA backbone conformations completely in most cases while reducing the size of the backbone torsional space [20].\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RNAGraphFeaturizer` module in `src/data/featurizer.py` can be used to process a PDB file containing a single RNA chain into a featurized geometric graph in PyTorch Geometric's `torch_geometric.data.Data` format:\n",
    "1. Each nucleotide is assigned a node in the geometric graph with the 3D coordinate corresponding to the centroid of the 3 bead atoms.\n",
    "2. Each node is connected by edges to its 32 nearest neighbours as measured by the distance between them.\n",
    "3. Node features include unit vectors, distances, angles, and torsions along the backbone from the 5' end to the 3' end, as well as unit vectors, distances, angles, and torsions from each C4' to the corresponding P and N1/N9.\n",
    "4. Edge features include unit vectors from the source to destination node, the distance encoded by 32 radial basis functions, and the distance along the backbone encoded by 32 sinusoidal positional encodings.\n",

    "<summary><b>gRNAde Model Architecture</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "### gRNAde Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gRNAde` module in `grnade.py` takes as input one or more PDB files corresponding to an RNA structure and featurizes them into a geometric graph as described in the previous section, with the identities of the nucleotide bases kept unknown.\n",
    "An instance of `RNAGraphFeaturizer` is internally instantiated within a gRNAde to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "gRNAde then processes the featurized geometric graph using the `AutoregressiveMultiGNNv1` module from `src/models.py` as follows:\n",
    "1. The geometric graph is encoded via an SE(3) equivariant and conformer order equivariant Graph Neural Network [21, 22] to build latent representations of the local 3D geometric neighbourhood of each nucleotide.\n",
    "2. Latent representations from multiple states at each nucleotide position are then pooled together via Deep Sets [23] to account for conformational variability, and decoded to predict a probability distribution over the four possible base identities (A, G, C, U).\n",
    "4. The probability distribution can then be sampled to design a set of candidate sequences for a single structure (single-state design) or a conformational ensemble (multi-state design).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the entire model is trained end-to-end by minimising a cross-entropy loss between the predicted probability distribution and the true sequence identity, as detailed in the `train()` function in `src/trainer.py`.\n",

    "<summary><b>Evaluation</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have obtained a set of designed sequences, how do we determine which sequences are useful and which ones to prioritise? Short of wet lab experimentation, the following in-silico metrics can be used to evaluate gRNAde's designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Native sequence recovery**, which is the average percentage of native (groundtruth) nucleotides correctly recovered in 16 sampled sequences. This is the most widely used metric for biomolecule inverse design [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Secondary structure self-consistency score**, where we 'forward fold' 16 sampled sequences using a secondary structure prediction tool (we used EternaFold) and measure the average Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to the groundtruth secondary structure. MCC values range between -1 and +1, with +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction. Similar forward folding metrics, sometimes termed 'designability', have been found to correlate with experimental success in 3D protein design [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perplexity**, which is the average exponential of the negative log-likelihood of 16 predicted sequences and can be thought of as the average number of bases that the model is selecting from for each nucleotide. A perfect model would have perplexity of 1, while a perplexity of 4 means that the model is making random predictions (the model outputs a probability over 4 possible bases). Perplexity does not require a groundtruth structure to calculate, and can also be used for ranking sequences based on the model's estimate of their compatibility with the structure to be designed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics are computed every time we use the `design()` function for the `gRNAde` module (described in detail subsequently), or via the `evaluate()` function in `src/trainer.py`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Prepare a PDB file for fixed-backbone re-design. For instance, we will use a [guanine riboswitch](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Guanine_riboswitch) aptamer domain (PDB ID: [4FE5](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4FE5)) for which the filepath is `/tutorial/demo_data/4FE5_1_B.pdb`.

    "    - `n_samples`, the number of samples which are designed by gRNAde for the input RNA structure.\n",
    "    - `temperature`, which is used to modulate the smoothness or sharpness of the probability distribution produced by the model. At lower temperatures, for instance <= 1, we expect to have higher native sequence recovery and lower diversity in the model's designs. At higher temperatures, the model produces more diverse designs by sampling from a smoothed probability distribution.\n",
    "    We recommend sampling at temperatures in the range 0.1 - 0.5 for the best results.\n",
    "    - `seed`, the random seed for obtaining reproducible results. \n",

    "4. Call the `design_from_pdb_file()` function from the `grnade_module` instance using the specified input and output filepaths as well as sampling configurations.\n",

    "2. Each subsequent entry contains a designed sequence. The description includes the sample number, the temperature of sampling, and evaluation metrics such as perplexity, native sequence recovery, and secondary structure self-consistency score.\n",

    "When comparing gRNAde to the native sequence recovery rates for Rosetta and the older FARNA technique (we took the numbers from Das et al. [18]), gRNAde has higher recovery of 54% on average compared to 45% for Rosetta and 32% for FARNA.\n",
    "Perhaps more importantly, we expect gRNAde to be significantly faster than Rosetta: gRNAde can design sequences for backbones with hundreds of nucleotides in under 1 second with GPU acceleration, while Rosetta make take an order of hours. While we have not run Rosetta ourselves, we note that its documentation states that \"runs on RNA backbones longer than ~ten nucleotides take many minutes or hours\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we plot native sequence recovery per sample for Rosetta vs. gRNAde, shaded by gRNAde’s average perplexity for each sample. Perplexity is an indicator of the model's confidence in its own prediction and appears to be correlated with native sequence recovery.\n",
    "Perplexity values from gRNAde's predictions are an indicator of the model's confidence in its own prediction and appear to be well correlated with native sequence recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the training and validation data for the gRNAde model explicitly excluded the 14 RNA structures as well as any structurally similar RNAs with TM-score threshold of 0.45 (we used US-align for clustering).\n",
    "Thus, we tried to ensure that gRNAde has not memorized the evaluation dataset for fair comparison."

    "### Multi-state inverse folding\n",
    "\n",
    "[Riboswitches](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/130) are flexible RNA molecules that adopt more than one distinct functional conformation, for instance a ligand bound (holo) and unbound (apo) state, which helps them regulate and control gene expression.\n",
    "Structural studies of an adenine riboswitch have found distinct structures for two unbound apo structures, one ligand-bound intermediate, and a final ligand-bound conformation [24].\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to attempt single-state inverse design for the adenine riboswitch, each structure may lead to a different set of sampled sequences for which recovery and self-consistency may vary widely.\n",
    "Thus, it is interesting to consider a design setting where we perform fixed-backbone re-design from multiple adenine riboswitch conformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/adenine_riboswitch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `design_from_directory()` function in the gRNAde module performs fixed-backbone re-design from a set of PDB files/RNA structures corresponding to the same RNA molecule, and optionally saves the designed sequences to a fasta file.\n",
    "The workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate a new multi-state variant of the gRNAde module by setting an appropriate `max_num_conformers` (in this example, we set it to 3 states).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prepare a directory containing PDB files for multi-state fixed-backbone re-design. For instance, we will use multiple conformations of the adenine riboswitch (PDB IDs: [5E54](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5E54), [5SWD](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5SWD) and [5SWE](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5SWE)) which are stored in the directory `/tutorial/demo_data/adenine_riboswitch/`. Note that each PDB file must contain only one chain and all RNA backbone atoms, corresponding to the same native RNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Specify an output filepath pointing to a fasta file where the designed sequences, corresponding evaluation metrics, and additional metadata will be saved. We will set this to `/tutorial/demo_output_multistate.fasta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set the configurations for the model's sampling process: `n_samples`, `temperature` and `seed`. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Call the `design_from_directory()` function from the `grnade_module` instance using the specified input and output filepaths as well as sampling configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Within seconds, the designed sequences will be saved to the fasta file `/tutorial/demo_output_multistate.fasta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>Running via the command line</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively to the workflow described above, we can also use the `gRNAde.py` script via command line arguments to achieve the same outcome, as follows:\n",

    "python gRNAde.py \\\n",

    "## Notes on methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to chose the number of states to provide as input to gRNAde? In general, this would depend on the design objective. For instance, designing a riboswitch may neccessitate multi-state design, while a single-state pipeline may be more sensible for locking an aptamer into its bound conformation [12]. Note that it may be possible to benefit from multi-state gRNAde models even when performing single-state design by using slightly noised variations of the same backbone structure as an input conformational ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How to prioritise or chose amongst designed sequences? We have currently provided 3 evaluation metrics: native sequence recovery, secondary structure self-consistency score and perplexity, towards this end. We suspect that recovery may not be the ideal choice, except for design scenarios where we require certain regions of the RNA to be conserved or native-like. Self-consistency score may be a more holistic evaluation metric as it accounts for alternative base pairings leading to similar structures, but may inherit the limitations of the secondary structure prediction method used as part of its computation.\n",
    "In realistic design scenarios, we can pair gRNAde with another machine learning model (an 'oracles') for ranking or predicting the suitability of designed sequences for the objective (for instance, binding affinity).\n",
    "We hope to conduct further experimental validation of gRANde designs in the wet lab in order to better understand these tradeoffs. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key limitation of gRNAde and avenues for future development include the lack of support for multiple interacting RNA chains, or accounting for biomolecular interactions of RNAs with proteins, small molecules, and other ligands.\n",
    "More advanced user configurations, such as only partial re-design of only prespecified nucleotides and negative design against undesired conformations are also not possible at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The multi-state GNN architecture currently uses Geometric Vector Perceptron GNN layers [22] combined with Deep Set pooling [23]. Future iterations of gRNAde will consider using more expressive geometric GNN layers [25] as well as set pooling functions [26] for improved modelling of RNA 3D geometry and conformational diversity. \n",
